        I am a software engineer with experience in development and testing in large scale web services and in-house tools. I have worked under several corporations such as IBM, BlackBerry, IFDS and most recently Microsoft as an SDET. I started my coding interesting learning java in high school school and continued to develop with it over two of my job placement working on front end web applications. During the recent 3 years I worked at Microsoft, I used C# and .NET technologies to prepare automated test cases and test framework to verify End to End and component functionality on the profile services backend that is used by outlook, one drive, office and many other partners. Spending a good amount of time as the stress/performance driver for the team, I had to work with SQL Server backend to deploy new schemas, migrate data and debug deployment issues; worked with Visual Studio Test Studio to execute stress and performance testing; and implemented a tool to automate the stress testing process & minimize manual interactions. Most recently, I have been learning about node.js and angular.js to increase my knowledge in javascript by playing with mobile app development with node.js as the backend.
